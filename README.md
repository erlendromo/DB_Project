## Description

TODO write something here...

## Endpoints

To see how each endpoint works, navigate to swagger-documentation on the application:
- If run locally: `http://localhost:8080/electromart/v1/swagger/`
- If run on vm: `http://<ip-to-vm>:8080/electromart/v1/swagger/`

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the application, make sure to have the following downloaded on the machine you are running.

- go -> https://go.dev/dl/
- swag -> In terminal: `go install github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag@latest`
    - If the swag binary isn't loaded properly in the terminal, the `make run` and `make swag` commands won't work. To fix possible issues with this, add the absolute path to where the swag-binary is located on your machine inside the commands in the Makefile. 
- postgresql -> https://www.postgresql.org/download/
- docker -> https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
- docker compose (linux) -> https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/#install-the-plugin-manually

- FOR WINDOWS USERS
    - gnuwin32 (make) -> https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm

## Deployment with Makefile

- `Configure .env file`
    - Before deploying, the example.env file will guide you to how a .env file used in this project can be setup. Configure this to satisfy your machines needs (all fields in example.env are required, but values can be amended).

- `Navigate to root-directory of project`
    - In a terminal of your choice, navigate to the root-directory of the project using commandline-tools (e.g. 'cd').

- `Make sure docker is running (docker desktop)`

- `Makefile commands`
    - `make run` -> Configures swag documentation, and starts the container for the application (This is all you need to use).
    - `make stop` -> Stops the container, and removes database-data (N.B. Use this if you want to refresh database with only dummy-data, if not -> do `make composedown`).
    - `make swag` -> Append the swagger notation to the application.
    - `make composeup` -> Runs a docker-container in the background, setting up postgres and the application.
    - `make composedown` -> Stops the docker-container.
    - `make applogs` -> Attaches the application-logs to the terminal.
    - `make dblogs` -> Attaches the database-logs to the terminal.
    - `make deletedbdata` -> Removes directory containing database-data. (This will be auto-generated when running `make composeup`).

- `Open REST-application of choice (Postman, Thunderclient etc.)`
    - Local-url: `http://localhost:8080/electromart/v1/`
    - Vm-url: `http://<ip-to-vm>:8080/electromart/v1/`
